# Contacts - SwiftUI

Contacts app represents a real world app example. it provides a fairly complex set of functionalities. It's a suitable showcase for all the advantages that SwiftUI, Combine, and modular architecture bring. It has all features that would make it a modular, scalable, testable and maintainable app.

## App Logic

- The app displays the list of userâ€™s contacts that are saved in `Realm` local database.
- If there's no data in `Realm`, it will be retrieved from contacts `CNContactStore` and saved locally in `Realm`.
- The local contacts are synchronized with `CNContactStore` in background every 15 minutes using `BGTaskScheduler`.
- The local contacts are synchronized every time the user opens the app.
